A photo gallery created using react and firebase(to store and retrieve photos). 
We can add photos and we will get the mew photo updated in real time without updating the page. 
Used firebase storage - to store the photos 
     firebase firestore - to get the real time image data

Firebase : 
go to firebase website. Go to console in it. create a new app.
disable the analytics. 
Create web </> . Give name. Copy the script. Paste it in config.js in firebase folder. 
This will be used for connecting our app with firebase server

npm i firebase.
import * as firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/storage';   //storage to store our images
import 'firebase/firestore'  //firestore is the database

const projectStorage = firebase.storage();
const projectFirestore = firebase.firestore();

export { projectStorage, projectFirestore}



firebase database 
storage



npm i framer-motion

We used .env to store our config data 
npm i dotenv 
create a .env file 
Store the data in form of key value pairs. 
Name of the keys should be in capital and they should start with "REACT_APP"
 //In the file where we want to use .env file : 
    env.config()
    process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY
